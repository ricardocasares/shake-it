# shake-it

Shake it is a websockets game intended to be played with smartphones at conferences.

Check the instructions for the demo.

## Game instructions

### Presenter

On the computer connected to a projector open the url where you are hosting the game and attach a query string `?admin` to it. This will be the presenter's screen.

Open the [presenter screen here](https://shakeit.analogic.al/?admin).

### Players

Each player should open the game using their smartphones with the URL provided in the QR code.

Players will be represented on the presenter screen as a colored circle. The screen background on the player screen will be colored the same as the circle on the presenter screen.

Whenever the presenter starts the game, players should start shaking their smartphones in order to make their colored circle go up to the finishing line.
